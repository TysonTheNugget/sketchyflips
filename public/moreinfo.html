        <h2>Welcome to Bet-A-Sketchy!</h2>
        <p>
            Bet-A-Sketchy is an exciting blockchain-based game where two players stake their SketchyMilios NFTs in a fair coin flip showdown. Powered by Gelato VRF for true randomness, the winner takes both NFTs! It's simple, thrilling, and fully on-chain using the contract at 0xf6b8d2E0d36669Ed82059713BDc6ACfABe11Fde6 on ABChain.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Step-by-step guide based on the game's smart contract and UI:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Connect Wallet:</strong> Use MetaMask to connect your account. The app will fetch your SketchyMilios NFTs from contract 0x08533a2b16e3db03eebd5b23210122f97dfcb97d.</li>
            <li><strong>Select NFT:</strong> Click "Select NFT" to choose a SketchyMilio from your owned tokens (displayed as images from backblazeb2.com).</li>
            <li><strong>Create Game:</strong> Approve and transfer your NFT to the contract via createGame(). Emits GameCreated event; wait for someone to join.</li>
            <li><strong>Join Game:</strong> Browse open games in the list, select one, approve your NFT, and call joinGame(). Triggers randomness request via Gelato VRF.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolve Game:</strong> Once joined, VRF fulfills randomness in _fulfillRandomness(), determining winner (50/50). Winner gets both NFTs. Check results in the "Results" button/modal.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancel Options:</strong> Creators can cancel unjoined games after 1 hour via cancelUnjoinedGame(). Joined games can be canceled by either player after 24 hours if not resolved via cancelGame().</li>
            <li><strong>View Open/Resolved Games:</strong> Open games show in the list with join/cancel buttons. Resolved games appear in the results modal with resolve/replay options, playing win/lose videos.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Risks and Important Notes</h2>
        <p class="risks">
            Key risks from the contract and app logic:
        </p>
        <ul class="risks">
            <li>Staking real SketchyMilios NFTs—losing transfers ownership permanently to the winner via nft.transferFrom().</li>
            <li>Transactions can fail due to insufficient gas (just increase gas and try again), network issues, or RPC errors (e.g., code -32603: Disconnect/reconnect MetaMask).</li>
            <li>Gelato VRF may have rare delays in fulfillment; use cancel if stuck after 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Beta stage: Potential UI glitches (e.g., video playback errors) or backend socket disconnects—reconnect attempts are automatic.</li>
            <li>Immutable blockchain: No refunds; all transfers/events are final. Always verify on ABScan.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tips and Troubleshooting</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <p>
                - Contract verified on ABScan; VRF by Gelato for fairness/transparency.<br>
                - Errors? Force-close MetaMask/Web3 app, retry. Check status messages for RPC issues.<br>
                - Failures possible (e.g., network congestion), but blockchain remains true—verify tx on ABScan.<br>
                - Stable connection recommended; enough gas for approve/transfer calls.<br>
                - UI updates via Socket.IO: If disconnected, app auto-reconnects and re-registers address.
