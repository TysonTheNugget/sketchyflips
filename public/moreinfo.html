        <h2>Welcome to the Coin Flip Game!</h2>
        <p>
            Coin Flip Game is an exciting blockchain-based game where two players stake their NFTs in a fair coin flip showdown. Powered by Gelato VRF for true randomness, the winner takes both NFTs! It's simple, thrilling, and fully on-chain.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a step-by-step guide on what you need to do to get started and enjoy the game:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create a Game:</strong> Connect your wallet, select an NFT you own, and create a new game. Your NFT will be transferred to the contract as your stake.</li>
            <li><strong>Join a Game:</strong> Browse open games, choose one, select your NFT, and join. Both NFTs are now staked, and randomness is automatically requested via Gelato VRF.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Resolution:</strong> Once randomness is fulfilled, the winner is determined (50/50 chance), and both NFTs are transferred to the winner.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancel Options:</strong> If a game isn't joined within 1 hour, the creator can cancel and retrieve their NFT. If joined but not resolved after 24 hours, either player can cancel to get their NFTs back.</li>
            <li><strong>View Open Games:</strong> Check the list of available unjoined games to find one to join.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Risks and Important Notes</h2>
        <p class="risks">
            While the game is designed to be fair and secure, remember:
        </p>
        <ul class="risks">
            <li>You are staking real NFTs—losing means you permanently transfer ownership to the winner.</li>
            <li>Blockchain transactions can fail due to network congestion, gas fees, or wallet issues. Always double-check before confirming.</li>
            <li>Gelato VRF ensures randomness, but delays in fulfillment could occur (though rare).</li>
            <li>As this is beta, bugs might exist. Test with low-value NFTs first.</li>
            <li>No refunds or reversals—blockchain is immutable. All actions are final.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tips and Troubleshooting</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <p>
                - The contract is verified on ABScan, and VRF is provided by Gelato for transparency and fairness.<br>
                - If you encounter errors (e.g., transaction fails or UI glitches), try force-closing MetaMask or your Web3 app and retrying.<br>
                - Things can fail due to external factors, but the blockchain always remains true—check transaction status on ABScan.<br>
                - For best experience, use a stable connection and ensure your wallet has enough gas.
